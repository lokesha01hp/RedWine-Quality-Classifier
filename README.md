# RedWine-Quality-Classifier-Using-Different-Models

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Wine Quality Classifier** using machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical features. The pipeline includes **clean EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and model saving** for testing.

Trained and compared **four models** to identify the best performer for wine quality classifier:
