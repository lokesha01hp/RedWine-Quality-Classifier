# RedWine-Quality-Classifier-Using-Different-Classification-Models

## Project Overview

- This project implements a ****Wine Quality Classifier using machine learning and a neural network to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical features.
- The pipeline includes **clean EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, model comparison and model saving that has the best accuracy** for testing.

---
## Model Comparison

Trained and compared **four models** to identify the best performer for the wine quality classifier:

| Model                     | Accuracy |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier  | 0.88     |
| Support Vector Classifier | 0.87     |
| Neural Network (MLP)      | 0.89     |
| XGBoost Classifier        | 0.91     |

## Winner of the Trend:
We can see that, with a model accuracy of 91%, the XGBoost Classifier, an ensemble machine learning algorithm, wins.
